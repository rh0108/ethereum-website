# aztec-crypto-js

This library contains methods required to construct AZTEC zero-knowledge proofs, and to create the required [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) signatures in order to spend AZTEC notes.  

## IMPORTANT: The deployed AZTEC smart contracts use a trusted setup created by AZTEC and should only be used for testing and development purposes. We will be launching a multiparty computation protocol to create a trusted setup that is secured by the wider Ethereum community. (TODO add how to participate)  

To see how this library can be used to issue AZTEC confidential transactions and create AZTEC notes, view our demonstration script and documentation in ```demo```.
