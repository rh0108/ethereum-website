#### Free Transactions

The AZTEC SDK uses the gas station network to send transactions so the end user does not have to pay for Gas. In order to use this service you will need an API key. You can request one [ here ](https://www.google.com).The AZTEC docs are designed to work on the Rinkeby network. We will be updating them to work on Ganache in Q2. 



#### Test Ether & Test Dai

The docs make use of a test ERC20 token Dai, which has mintable privalages. The token is deployed to the following address `0xasdfasdfaasdfasdfads`. Each example lets the user request Test Eth or Test Dai if they run out.
