## Privacy engine and the SDK
AZTEC is a privacy engine for Ethereum, enabling confidential transactions over public mainnet. The protocol makes use of zero-knowledge proofs in order to encrypt and obscure the values of AZTEC enabled transactions.

This documentation site provides everything you need to get started with the protocol via it's associated SDK. The SDK is the principle method whereby developers can interact with AZTEC and can be imported into your Dapp with one line of code. 

These docs describe and explain the API, using demo code examples via live in-page JavaScript consoles to show how the SDK can be integrated.
