The AZTEC note registry contract is a subset of the AZTEC Cryptography Engine, but we describe it explicitly given its importance to the protocol.  

The note registry contains the storage variables that define the set of valid AZTEC notes for a given address. It is expected this address maps to a smart contract, but this is not enforced.  

The note registry enacts the instructions generated by valid AZTEC proofs - creating and destroying the required notes, as well as transferring any required tokens.  

The note registry's `owner` is the only entity that can issue instructions to update the registry. `NoteRegistry` will only enact instructions that have been generated by a valid AZTEC proof as it is of critical importance that notes are not created/destroyed unless a **balancing relationship** has been satisfied.  

Because every confidential asset that uses an ACE note registry can have 100% confidence in the integrity of the state of every *other* ACE note registry, it makes it possible to express AZTEC notes from one registry as a percentage of notes in a second registry, which in turn is useful for dividend-paying confidential assets and confidential assets that utilize income streaming.
